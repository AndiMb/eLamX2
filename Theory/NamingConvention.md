# Naming convention for technical reports

Technical reports related to the theories used in eLamXÂ² should be published here (`eLamX2/Theory`) using the following naming convention:

`TR_XXX_DescriptionWithoutSpaces.pdf` 

where `XXX` is an ongoing numbering, consisting of three digits with leading zeros starting by *001*. `DescriptionWithoutSpaces` shall be replaced by a meaningful descriptive title (e.g. *ClassicalLaminateTheory*) without spaces.
